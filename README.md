The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a historical dataset. 
1)Data Preprocessing:
Handle any potential missing values.
Normalize and standardize the 'Time' and 'Amount'
features.
Ensure that the PCA-transformed features are
appropriately scaled.
2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze transaction patterns.
Visualize the distribution of fraudulent vs. non
fraudulent transactions.
Identify correlations between features
3)Feature Engineering:
Utilize the 'Time' and 'Amount' features for additional
insights.
Consider interactions between PCA components.
4)Model Development:
Evaluate various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural
Networks).
Address class imbalance using techniques such as
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
or class weighting.
5)Model Evaluation:
Use cross-validation to assess model robustness.
Evaluate performance using metrics such as Precision,
Recall, F1-Score.
6)Deployment:
Deploy the model in a real-time environment.
